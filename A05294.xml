            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Great in conuenience doeth folowe to ſaye that the Maſſe is a ſacrifice for ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. For ſaynt Paule ſayeth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſynnes is not without
<pb facs="tcp:7581:41"/> ſheddinge of bloude. Howe is Chriſt then offered in the Maſſe when there is no offeringe wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloude, for if there be any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that ſuffereth not and is without bloude. Saynt Paules Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are foliſhe, and of no ſtrength or vertue, ſaying. Chriſt offreth hymſelfe no more or elles he muſte neceſſarily dye once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and muſt haue died often tymes ſens the begininge of the worlde. But vndoubtly, S Paul doeth knowe the true ſence and meaneinge of holly ſcripture bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of al the papiſtes. For a ſacrifice for ſinne is neuer offred without bloud. This ſaying ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, that ſome thing was offered in the olde lawe, as breade wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloude, maketh nothinge for there purpoſe. For when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of lyuinge creatures are ſlayne, and ſacrifice is offered for ſinnes, bloude muſt be ſhed. Thei
<pb facs="tcp:7581:42"/> cannot therefore proue, by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Chriſtes bloude is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Maſſe, otherwyſe then in remembraunce, and thankes giuing. And thys is done both of the miniſters and receiuours. For as prayer, ſo thankes giuing alſo belongeth, to al men. He that geueth thankes, ſayeth not I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer any thing more than a than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full herte and prayſe to God. If the people were taught thys do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. They woulde not beſtowe ſomuch monie on maſſes and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacions of chauntries, and fraternities as they haue done, throughe perſuacion, that remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſynnes, is obtayned in the Maſſe, not by grace promiſed to them that beleue, but by offering of Chriſte the ſonne of God and by prayeinge for hym. Phie, I am aſhamed, to reherſſe thys abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable balaſphemie of theirs in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of God. The papiſtes in as
<pb facs="tcp:7581:42"/> muche as in them lyeth, kill and crucifie Chriſte agayne in there ſacrifice of the Maſſe, doinge no other wyſe then if Chriſte as yet were not aſcended into heauen, to hys father he that doeth thys, maketh Chriſte ſubiecte to death and crucifieth hym agayne. For Chriſte entred not nor entreth in to the hollye place of heauen, but by his bloud. Let vs labour, that Chriſt maye dwell in oure hertes They obeicte, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if it be derogaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Chriſtes honour, and digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, and that the merite of hys pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion be not perfecte becauſe we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffer Chriſte agayne: fayeth, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and kepinge of godes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes maye diminiſhe the dignitie of Chriſte, and full merites of his paſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould not nede to do any good workes. This is a foliſh and an vnmete: compariſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe verely of Chriſte agayne, is
<pb facs="tcp:7581:43"/> contrary to fayeth and good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. For they glorifye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> merittes of Chriſtes paſſion, when the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of him agayne is greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogacion to the ſame. They do as a man that lyghteth a candle, in a bright ſunnye Daye, ſaynge all thoughe the ſunne giueth a light cleare inoughe it of ſelfe: yet it is neceſſarye, and profitable that more lyght be put thereto.

            <p>You haue the bryghte daye in deriſion, as if the ſunne were not ſufficiente wyth out your lyght.

No man muſte take vppon hym, the dignitye of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode cxcepte he be called of God as Aaron, and thei which were of the lymage of Aaron.

And if they wyll haue it to a gree, both to the prieſtes, of the olde lawe and newe Teſtamente: they moſt proue whether they be, prieſtes or no.

For Chriſt &amp; hys church ſo agree and ſo conſente together. That what ſo euer the one doth the other agre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to the ſame. But thys is a lye. For if Chriſte died for vs, then the church muſt do the ſame. Chriſt is the bread &amp; highe prieſte. Ergo we are the bread and highe prieſt alſo. Chriſte was offered ſay they wyth payne, and ſufferinge of the bodie. Ergo he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be offered &amp; ſuffer not. He was once a ſacrifice, ergo he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:7581:53"/> be a ſacrifice againe. But this ther talke is vayne and foleſhe. For we ſeke not what Chriſt might do but what he dyd. And what the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth. Alſo they obiecte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is better to gyue, then to take. In ſacrifice we giue, &amp; in our Lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des ſupper we take it is therefore better to offer. But let them firſt proue who gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authoritie to do ſacrifice after thys man. It is better to be a ſauioure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſeruante. Therfore as it is a greate blaſphemie, a man to ſaye he is a god, and ſauiour, ſo it is great blaſphemy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinners ſhall go a bout to offer Chriſt for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes.
